# Learning go


This repo is for projects I've made with golang while I teach myself. 

I'm finding tutorials online and following along to get used to the language. When I'm more confident with the basics, I'll start doing exercisms.

<small>Each project has its own readme and sources.</small>

## Summary


#### 03-microservice

Simple microservice style API, one resource from a MongoDB, all restful routes except update. 

--

#### 02-nosql-db

This was an interesting one, the tutorial I followed was using CouchbaseDB, so I found instructions for mgo for MongoDB and implemented that instead. 

--

#### 01-first-api

This is a super basic api, no connection to a DB, just routing.
